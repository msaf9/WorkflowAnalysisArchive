The aim of Triton is to provide an open-source environment for expressing tensor math workloads that offers high flexibility, developer productivity and end to end performance.\n \n The foundations of this project are described in the following MAPL2019 publication: [Triton: An Intermediate Language and Compiler for Tiled Neural Network Computations](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~htk/publication/2019-mapl-tillet-kung-cox.pdf).
