This pattern, though notoriously computationally expensive, also generates a large amount of highly parallelizable work particularly well suited for multi- and many- core processors.\n \n As a consequence, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become a cheap and accessible resource for exploring and/or deploying novel research ideas in the field. This trend has been accelerated by the release of several frameworks for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing, such as CUDA and OpenCL, which have made the development of high-performance programs easier. Yet, GPUs remain incredibly challenging to optimize for locality and parallelism, especially for computations that cannot be efficiently implemented using a combination of pre-existing optimized primitives. To make matters worse, GPU architectures are also rapidly evolving and specializing, as evidenced by the addition of tensor cores to NVIDIA (and more recently AMD) micro-architectures.\n \n-This tension between the computational opportunities offered by DNNs and the practical difficulty of GPU programming has created substantial academic and industrial interest for Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and compilers.

This relatively low-level format makes it difficult to statically analyze the runtime behavior (e.g., cache misses) of input programs, and to  automatically optimize loops accordingly through the use of tiling [WOLFE1989]_, fusion [DARTE1999]_ and interchange [ALLEN1984]_. To solve this issue, polyhedral compilers [ANCOURT1991]_ rely on program representations that have statically predictable control flow, thereby enabling aggressive compile-time program transformations for data locality and parallelism. Though this strategy has been adopted by many languages and compilers for DNNs such as Tiramisu [BAGHDADI2021]_, Tensor Comprehensions [VASILACHE2018]_, Diesel [ELANGO2018]_ and the Affine dialect in MLIR [LATTNER2019]_, it also comes with a number of limitations that will be described later in this section.\n \n-+++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n Program Representation\n-+++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n \n Polyhedral compilation is a vast area of research.

Most of these transformations actually boil down to the production of  schedules and iteration domains that enable loop transformations promoting parallelism and spatial/temporal data locality (e.g., fusion, interchange, tiling, parallelization).\n \n Polyhedral compilers can also automatically go through complex verification processes to ensure that the semantics of their input program is preserved throughout this optimization phase. Note that polyhedral optimizers are not incompatible with more standard optimization techniques. In fact, it is not uncommon for these systems to be implemented as a set of LLVM passes that can be run ahead of more traditional compilation techniques [GROSSER2012]_.\n \n All in all, polyhedral machinery is extremely powerful, when applicable. It has been shown to support most common loop transformations, and has indeed achieved performance comparable to state-of-the-art GPU libraries for dense matrix multiplication [ELANGO2018]_. Additionally, it is also fully automatic and doesn't require any hint from programmers apart from source-code in a C-like format. \n \n-++++++++++++\n++++++++++++\n Limitations\n-++++++++++++\n++++++++++++\n \n Unfortunately, polyhedral compilers suffer from two major limitations that have prevented its adoption as a universal method for code generation in neural networks.\n \n@@ -127,9 +128,10 @@ Second, the polyhedral framework is not very generally applicable; SCoPs are rel\n \n On the other hand, blocked program representations advocated by this dissertation are less restricted in scope and can achieve close to peak performance using standard dataflow analysis.\n \n------------------------\n+\n+--------------------\n Scheduling Languages\n------------------------\n+--------------------\n \n Separation of concerns [DIJKSTRA82]_ is a well-known design principle in computer science: programs should be decomposed into modular layers of abstraction that separate the semantics of their algorithms from the details of their implementation. Systems like Halide and TVM push this philosophy one step further, and enforce this separation at the grammatical level through the use of a  **scheduling language**. The benefits of this methodology are particularly visible in the case of matrix multiplication, where, as one can see below, the definition of the algorithm (Line 1-7) is completely disjoint from its implementation (Line 8-16), meaning that both can be maintained, optimized and distributed independently. \n \n@@ -156,17 +158,17 @@ Separation of concerns [DIJKSTRA82]_ is a well-known design principle in compute\n \n The resulting code may however not be completely portable, as schedules can sometimes rely on execution models (e.g., SPMD) or hardware intrinsics (e.g., matrix-multiply-accumulate) that are not widely available.

I do believe that this is not a fundamental issue of scheduling languages -- in the sense that it could probably be solved with more efforts -- but it could mean that these systems are harder to engineer. More importantly, existing scheduling languages generate loops whose bounds and increments cannot depend on surrounding loop indices without at least imposing severe constraints on possible schedules -- if not breaking the system entirely.
